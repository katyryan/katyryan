### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- My name is Kate Ryan and my pronouns are she/her/hers.
- I live in San Francisco and I work at GitHub. 
- Outside of work, I like to spend time with family, cook, read, write, swim, and hike. 
- I'm always interested in new recipes and coookbooks, and I'm currently trying to find time to re-learn how to play the guitar.
